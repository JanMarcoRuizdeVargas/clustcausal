Neural Solver for GM:
    Conditional Random Fieldswhether 
    CV guys know about it
    what Pearl & others have
    investigate cited sources, books

Have NN/ML Model extract features, then do causal inference on theseif the features are explainable would be cool!

how do statistical dependencies differ from real world dependencies like dynamical flow

non parametrical causal models?

joint function fitting with NN (f in ANM) plus causal dependence?

general NN with several submodel and depending on the task (also being input) the nn can decide what submodel to use/it tunes itself

Neural Network generated from Graph generator and then trained (like in Ch10 MLGS)
((How is gradient backpropagation update different from L3 reasoning? How is human learning different from L3 reasoning and gradient backpropagation?))
